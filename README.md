ðŸŽµ Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System using CNN
This repository features an innovative music recommendation system that uses facial emotion recognition to suggest music tracks. 
The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions and match them with music that aligns with the user's emotional state.
Key Features
Facial Emotion Recognition: Uses CNNs to classify emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, calm) from facial images captured in real-time or from photos.
Music Recommendation: Suggests music tracks that correspond to the detected emotion, enhancing the user's listening experience.
Audio Analysis: Integrates with audio features (optional) for better recommendation accuracy.
Dataset Compatibility: Works with standard facial emotion datasets (e.g., FER2013) and music datasets for training and testing.
Real-Time Compatibility: Designed to work with live webcam feeds or pre-recorded images for emotion detection.
